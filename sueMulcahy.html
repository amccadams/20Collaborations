           My abstract images are an exploration of the mysteries of life. In poetry, it is in the things that are not said, that truth lies: the space between the lines, the underlying rhythms and structures. My images operate in much the same way. If my audience is touched, it is through their own exploration. Fundamental to all my work is a philosophy that the process of art is analogous to living. It is an activity bound by time, molded by opportunity, choice and experience, and marked by failure and success.</br>
          I jumped at the opportunity to collaborate on this unique book project. I have always liked working with other artists, but that usually involves setting up exhibits and community projects. In this case Britt and I are truly combining our individual skills to make a single creative piece. I consider my work as a conversation with the subject and the material; this time it is also a conversation with another artist…fun.”</p>
