    <h3 >How the Concept Was Developed</h3>
<p >I conceived of this project in 2009 while collaborating with Leslie Haines, a brilliant designer, educator, and type geek. I asked Leslie if she would consider creating an artist book with me, knowing that while she had never worked in this way before, her art and design seemed to lend themselves perfectly to the medium. She enthusiastically agreed and the successful result was, I Spy. I found myself thinking how great it would be to embark on a similar collaborative project with multiple artists--an exciting idea that I would tuck away for the possible future. </p>

<p >Later my friend and colleague Susan Hulme proposed collaborating on a custom clamshell box for an artist book, Dream Forest, that she had produced with Alan LeQuire. The book was beautifully designed, printed, and bound. Susan’s interpretation of Alan’s work in book form allowed the viewer to enjoy and interact with it in a way his sculptures and prints could never allow. “Now this is an artist book,” I told Susan. </p> 


<p >After a long discussion about the possibilities of artist books, binding techniques, and all things book, I determined it was time. I would ask 20 locally-based artists, who had never made an artist book before, to consider bringing their work to this form. Some participants would work with me on structure alone while others would collaborate conceptually and visually as well as structurally. </p>

<h3>Creating the Plan</h3>
<p >The intention of the project would be to bring book art to a wider audience and to demonstrate the creative potential within all artists to utilize the book form. Furthermore, an exhibition of the work produced would use technology to better connect the audience with the works. Book art is usually limited to one-page spreads and kept under plexiglass. This is the only way to protect the art, but it limits the viewer’s ability to fully experience the book. In our conceived exhibit, each book would be photographed and transformed into digital media so that visitors could use their smart phones or tablets to access all pages of each book on exhibit. Amanda McCadams of Digital Wonder Cabinet became the brains and talent behind this part of the project. </p>

<p >We would have a year to collaborate on this project in order to produce 20 individual one-of-a-kind books. I wrote up the proposal and developed my wish list of artists. To my happy surprise, all 20 agreed--and quickly! I then proposed this project to a venue that was willing to take a risk with us and agreed to show the resulting exhibit without knowing what the work would look like or even if all 20 participants would be able to make the one-year deadline. </p>

<h3>Choosing the Venue</h3>
<p >In my mind, there was only one choice of venue--the Nashville Public Library. Not only does the Library possess and share the Wilson Limited Editions Collection with the public, it has been a supporter of artist books and book artists for decades. I have also admired the quality exhibits that Liz Coleman curates for years and have been lucky to have participated in a few of them. Liz also provides public programming that includes workshops in bookbinding techniques, and started a book arts club that regularly meets at the library. My proposed exhibit had to be at the Library, and the Library agreed.</p><figure class="aboutImage2">

<h3>The Final Product</h3>
<p >This exhibit represents one year of work and collaboration. It challenged all involved and forced each and every one of us out of our comfort zone. We surpassed 20 collaborations long ago. Amanda McCadams produced the virtual exhibit/digital component and Mark Mosrie painstakingly photographed all of the work. The resulting collaboration between the two of them is an outstanding stand-alone project. Some of the books even include other artists, not in the original participant list, who lent their talents to the production of the final works. Bryce McCloud, Jerry Phillips, and Lana Beardslee were also huge contributors to the project all coming together.</p>
