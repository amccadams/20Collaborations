          The twist on my project:
When 20 Collaborations in Book Art was conceived, the project was based on 19 individuals who had never utilized the book form for their work and with whom I would collaborate to produce 20 one of a kind artist books. Since Susan and I are both experienced book artists/fine edition bookbinders, I thought an interesting twist would be for us to collaborate on one single book as a team. I would create the art and Susan would design and execute the binding. Essentially it flipped the role I had with the participants. Artists had to trust me to guide their work into the book form and in most cases, craft the binding and custom enclosures. In much the same way I had to put myself into that position and trust Susan in the same way I had asked of the others. Together we created W.E.S.. I love the direction she took the work. Not only did the final product exceed my expectations, but her balance of fine 17th century binding skill with a contemporary design nod is amazing.

                   Britt Stadig is a practicing and exhibiting studio artist, bookbinder, and designer in Nashville, TN. In addition to teaching at Volunteer State Community College, Britt runs a bookbinding studio. She received her BFA in painting and printmaking from the University of Connecticut and an MFA in book arts and printmaking from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA.<br />
                   
           My work is primarily mixed media. It incorporates sewing, drawing, printmaking, 
hand-set and stamped type. I use the book form to question the invisible barrier that can happen between the work and the viewer. I enjoy creating narratives that the audience can engage with in a more tactile way. It plays on the theme of family secrets, and the fragility of memory. I create and weave text into my work that will function as both image and narrative. The work is meant to conceal and reveal with no definitive conclusion.
