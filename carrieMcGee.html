           Invitation to See takes the form of a tunnel book, sometimes called a peepshow book, a structure historically inspired by theatrical stage sets. </br>
Placed in-the-round, the book consists of thirteen freestanding pages of varying transparency. The viewer is invited to look into and through the book. Some pages contain window openings, while others reveal echoes of windows, along with incidental markings and colorations – intimations of inner life.</br>
In working on this piece I considered it in turns as sculptural object, house, body, and soul. Allowing the viewer to see in required a careful balance of transparency and opacity, turning things inside out a bit, 
moving the more transparent pages to the outside of the work. More than anything I wanted to arrive at a state of visibility, of being seen, and struggled with the difficulty of doing just that.</p>

        Carrie McGee's mixed media constructions explore emotional tone within repeated form. Utilizing transparent plastics as a ground, she experiments with natural and chemical processes, such as rust and oxidation, to create luminous works that emanate a meditative pulse.</br>
McGee's investigations developed on the periphery of her work as an abstract painter. In the midst of a studio move she discovered a sheet of vinyl containing a multi-layered pattern of rust spheres, the result of a slow ceiling leak. The illuminated metal impressions were unexpectedly beautiful, and possessed a combination of organic and industrial qualities McGee sought in her paintings. Initially experienced as playful experimentation, this work became the central focus of McGee's efforts, and soon evolved from ephemeral to lasting and architectural in scope.</br>
McGee has lived in many parts of the United States, having migrated from Cincinnati to Los Angeles, New York, and finally Nashville. She has worked in historic buildings as a conservation painter, and as a scenic painter for a variety of films and sets.</br>

McGee received a Visual Arts Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts/Southern Arts Federation, as well as a residency fellowship from the Christoph Merian Foundation in Basel, Switzerland.Her paintings and constructions have been exhibited regularly for the past twenty years.</p>
